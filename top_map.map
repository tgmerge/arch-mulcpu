Number of warnings:   32
Logic Utilization:
  Total Number Slice Registers:       1,185 out of   9,312   12%
    Number used as Flip Flops:          769
    Number used as Latches:             416
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,344 out of   9,312   25%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,622 out of   4,656   34%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,622 out of   1,622 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,622   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,480 out of   9,312   26%
    Number used as logic:             2,344

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 23 out of     232    9%
  Number of RAMB16s:                      1 out of      20    5%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     7 out of      24   29%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                3.32

Peak Memory Usage:  264 MB
Total REAL time to MAP completion:  12 secs 
Total CPU time to MAP completion:   3 secs 

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
